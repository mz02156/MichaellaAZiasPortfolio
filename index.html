<h1>Michaella Alexsandra Zias - My Portfolio</h1>
<p><strong>Computer Science · Music Technology · Software Engineering</strong></p>

<p> 
I graduated from Georgia Southern University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My work focused on algorithmic music analysis, interface design, mobile and web applications, and explainable recommendation systems, as this fit the curriculum of the degree I was pursuing.

My Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is a stepping stone. While it has confirmed my love for the technical aspects of problem solving, it has also revealed something was missing, and that is the creative fulfillment I find in music.

My long-term goal is to broaden my understanding of music aspects and go into audio engineering, music making, interactive music applications, and more to contribute to projects that enhance live performance, interactive sound, and immersive media, and make my way into roles such as audio technician, broadcast engineer, dialogue editor, DJ, record producer, among other things.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div class="project">
  <h3>CaribBeats – BPM-Aware Music Recommendation App- Intro to Software Engineering Group Project Fall 2024</h3>
  <p>
CaribBeats is the first music project I had the opportunity to do. This project stemmed from my love and passion for music as well as my and project partners' Caribbean background. In this project, I was more of the creative component. 
I designed and implemented the core user interface for the application, focusing on usability, visual structure, and smooth user interaction. This included building screens for playlist management (importing, viewing, and editing playlists) and implementing intuitive playback controls such as play, pause, and skip.
In addition to the interface design, I developed the application’s playback logic in Java, using conditional statements to dynamically select the next song based on the current track’s tempo. This logic enables intelligent song transitions and enhances the listening experience by maintaining musical flow.
I also participated in integration testing, documentation, and code reviews to ensure that the user interface and playback behavior worked seamlessly with the database and media components.

<div class="project">
  <h3>Melody Mate – Android app that plays music Spring 2025</h3>
  <p>
   This is a group project I was a part of and helped come up with the concept. Melody Mate was created using Jamendo API, and this was our first time using something like this. The app allowed users to search for a word, and a list of songs containing that word would be listed based on relevance. If the user chose a song, it would play. It contained pause/play, back, and a skip button.

  <h3>CariBeats – BPM-Aware Music Recommendation App- Senior Project Summer 2025</h3>
  <p>
CaribBeats had stuck with me, so for my Senior Project, I chose to revamp it and make it something I had dreamed it would be. I added machine learning for clustering moods and playlist making, and I made it an available website that anyone can use, as well as an app using Android Studio. I did many things with this project in the span of the 5 short weeks this mini-semester provided. 

This project was a long time coming, but it also had its ups and upsets. The point of this project was to showcase all the things I have learned from the many courses I have taken, as well as having the freedom to present them in any way I wanted. Sadly, this is not how it turned out in the end. CariBeats was constantly being questioned for its ability to showcase my understanding and abilities accurately and I had to constantly edit my work so that it wasn't difficult for my professor to understand so I created 3 different versions of CariBeats all somewhat functional to showcase different skills but with more time and understanding on how music and technology connect i will able to grow it into what it needs to be.

<div class="project">
  <h3>Muse – Personality-Driven Music Recommendation System Fall 2025</h3>
  <p>
Muse is a Human-centered music recommender that generates explainable song matches based on user personality and mood questionnaires. Muse was an idea I proposed to a couple of my peers for a group project for our Human-Computer Interaction class. I wanted to find a new way to recommend music to audiences. In the future, I would like Muse to be true to its name and inspire people. Right now, it simply recommends music to people, such as everyday listeners, DJs, and more, based on the situation, but it will be a place where people may create and mix music, and it will be equipped with a metronome and allow users to make their own profiles so they may store all their ideas and works.
